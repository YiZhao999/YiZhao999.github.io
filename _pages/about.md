Hi, I‚Äôm **Yi Zhao**, a Ph.D. student in **Political Science** at the University of Pittsburgh.  
My research sits at the intersection of **international relations** and **political economy**, with a particular focus on:

- How **diplomatic visits** and other forms of state-to-state interaction signal cooperation or conflict.  
- The role of **domestic politics** in shaping international economic cooperation and performance.  
- The impact of **policy interventions** on inequality and long-term economic outcomes.  
- Broader questions of **income inequality, populism, and democratization** in comparative contexts.  

Before starting my Ph.D., I earned an **M.A. in Global Studies** from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) and a **B.A. in Financial Management** from Nankai University. I also studied abroad at the **University of California, Berkeley** and **NEOMA Business School** in France, experiences that deepened my interest in global politics and international cooperation.  

At Pitt, I am both a **research assistant** and a **teaching assistant**, contributing to projects and courses in international relations and political science methods. Beyond my academic work, I enjoy engaging with colleagues across disciplines, from history to finance, to exchange ideas and broaden perspectives.  

This site collects my **research projects**, **datasets**, and **CV**. Feel free to explore, and don‚Äôt hesitate to reach out if you‚Äôd like to connect!
