Hi, I’m **Yi Zhao** (I go by Zoey), a Ph.D. student in **Political Science** at the University of Pittsburgh.  
My research sits at the intersection of **international relations** and **political economy**, with a particular focus on **economic statecraft** and **great power transition**. 

Before starting my Ph.D., I earned an **M.A. in Global Studies** from The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen and a **B.A. in Financial Management** from Nankai University in China. I also studied abroad at the **University of California, Berkeley** and **NEOMA Business School** in France, experiences that deepened my interest in global politics and international cooperation.  

This site brings together my **research projects**, **datasets**, and **CV**. Feel free to explore, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to connect!
